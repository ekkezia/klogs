    'Blockchain has been heralding the digital revolution with lots of promises and high hopes. Yet, the pace of adoption is slower than the hype might suggest, and its growth mainly takes place in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) sector.',
    'These public blockchains are ideal for DeFi use cases but are not usable in the real-world for data security and privacy reasons. Not to mention the slow speed and high fees involved in using these networks. Moreover, most blockchain platforms are open-source, but much of enterprise-grade software and app development is closed and proprietary in nature.',
    'While some blockchain platforms advertise to be enterprise-friendly, like Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, however, they are nevertheless open-source and do not provide commercially available enterprise-grade software. Even though some third-party vendors provide software solutions that are built on these open-source blockchain platforms, the abovementioned bottlenecks in performance and data protection remain unresolved and can only be addressed at the layer-1 (platform) level.',
