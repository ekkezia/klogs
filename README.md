# üìù klogs 
`klogs` is the portfolio site for my creative coding projects. A play on the word 'log' and inspired by the notebook, I designed the website to resemble the outlook of a notebook. 

Some features you may find in the site are:
1. Free drawing with `Konva.js` by clicking on the üñåÔ∏è icon at the home page. The drawing can be "erased" and "recovered" by dragging around the yellow dragger on the right side.
2. Customization of theme color (using `react-colorful`) by clicking the right box at the bottom-right corner.

### Frameworks & Libraries Used
1. Next.js
2. Tailwind CSS
3. Sanity.io
4. Framer Motion
5. react-colorful
6. react-konva
7. react-resizable-panels
8. zod

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
